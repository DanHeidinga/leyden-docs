Welcome to leyden-docs!
========================

This repository is for design notes, presentations, guides, FAQs, and
other collateral for [OpenJDK Project
Leyden](https://openjdk.org/projects/leyden).

Most documents here are written in (pandoc) Markdown.  Changes made to
the Markdown sources in the top-level `site` directory are automatically
formatted and published in the [Leyden project
area](https://openjdk.org/projects/leyden) on the OpenJDK web site.
Files elsewhere are not published.

See https://openjdk.org/ for more information about the OpenJDK
Community and the JDK.
